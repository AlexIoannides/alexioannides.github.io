<p>Once you have a viable solution to a Machine Learning (<span class="caps">ML</span>) task, that is often developed within a Jupyter notebook, you are then faced with an altogether different problem - how to engineer the solution into your product and how to maintain the performance of the solution as new instances of data are&nbsp;experienced.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-tutorial-going-to-teach-me">What is this Tutorial Going to Teach&nbsp;Me?</h2>
<ul>
<li>How to take a solution to a <span class="caps">ML</span> task, as developed within a Jupyter notebook, and map it into two separate Python modules for training a model and then deploying the trained model as a RESTful model-scoring <span class="caps">API</span>.</li>
<li>How to execute these &#8216;train&#8217; and &#8216;deploy&#8217; modules - that together form a simple <span class="caps">ML</span> pipeline (or workflow) - remotely on a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> cluster, using <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Bodywork</a>.</li>
<li>How to interact-with and test the model-scoring service that has been deployed to&nbsp;Kubernetes.</li>
<li>How to run the train-and-deploy workflow on a schedule, so the model is periodically re-trained when new data is available, but without the manual intervention of an <span class="caps">ML</span>&nbsp;engineer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve written at length on the subject of getting machine learning into production - an area that is now referred to as Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), and which is a hot topic within the field of <span class="caps">ML</span> engineering. For example, my <a href="../../../../2019/01/10/deploying-python-ml-models-with-flask-docker-and-kubernetes/">blog post</a> on <em>Deploying Python <span class="caps">ML</span> Models with Flask, Docker and Kubernetes</em> is viewed by hundreds of <span class="caps">ML</span> practitioners every month; at the recent <a href="https://databricks.com/dataaisummit/europe-2020/agenda?_sessions_focus_tax=productionizing-machine-learning">Data and <span class="caps">AI</span> Summit</a> there was an entire track devoted to ‘Productionizing Machine Learning’; Thoughtwork’s <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/intelligent-enterprise-series-cd4ml">essay</a> on <em>Continuous Delivery for <span class="caps">ML</span></em> is now an essential reference for all <span class="caps">ML</span> engineers, together with Google’s <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/hash/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Abstract.html">paper</a> on the <em>Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems</em>; and MLOps even has its own entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-mlops-getting-so-much-attention">Why is MLOps Getting so Much&nbsp;Attention?</h3>
<p>In my opinion, this is because we are at a point where a significant number of organisations have now overcome their data ingestion and engineering problems. They are able to provide their data scientists with the data required to solve business problems using machine learning, only to find that, as Thoughtworks put&nbsp;it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Getting machine learning applications into production is hard</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To tackle some of the core complexities of MLOps, <span class="caps">ML</span> engineering teams appear to have settled on approaches that are based-upon deploying containerised <span class="caps">ML</span> models, usually as RESTful model-scoring services, to some type of cloud platform. Kubernetes is especially useful for this as I have <a href="../../../../2019/01/10/deploying-python-ml-models-with-flask-docker-and-kubernetes/">written about before</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bodywork-for-mlops">Bodywork for&nbsp;MLOps</h3>
<p>Containerising <span class="caps">ML</span> code using <a href="https://docs.docker.com">Docker</a>, pushing the build artefacts to an image repository and then configuring Kubernetes to orchestrate <span class="caps">ML</span> pipelines into batch jobs and services, requires skills and expertise that most <span class="caps">ML</span> engineers do not have the time (and often the desire) to learn. Scale this scenario into one where there are multiple models to worry about, all needing to be re-trained and re-deployed, and it is easy to imagine how large and undesirable a burden this can&nbsp;become.</p>
<p>This is where the <a href="https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Bodywork MLOps framework</a> steps-in - to deliver your code to the right place and then execute it at the right time, so that your models are trained, deployed and available to the rest of your team. Bodywork is a tool aimed at <span class="caps">ML</span> engineers to help&nbsp;them:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuously deliver <span class="caps">ML</span> code - for training models and defining model-scoring services - by pulling it directly from Git repositories and into pre-built containers running on&nbsp;Kubernetes.</li>
<li>automate the configuration of Kubernetes jobs and deployments to run complex <span class="caps">ML</span> workflows, that result in <span class="caps">ML</span> model-scoring service&nbsp;deployments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, Bodywork automates the repetitive tasks that most <span class="caps">ML</span> engineers think of as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a>, allowing them to focus their time on what they do best - machine&nbsp;learning.</p>
<p>This post serves as a short tutorial on how to use Bodywork to productionise the most common MLOps use-case -&nbsp;train-and-deploy.</p>
<p><img alt="train_and_deploy" src="../../../../images/machine-learning-engineering/bodywork/concepts_train_and_deploy.png"></p>
<p>We will refer to the <a href="https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project">example bodywork <span class="caps">ML</span> project (GitHub) repository</a> and the files within&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>If you want to execute the example code, then you will&nbsp;need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to <a href="https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/">install</a> the bodywork Python package on your local&nbsp;machine.</li>
<li>access to a Kubernetes cluster - either locally using <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker-for-desktop</a>, or as a managed service from a cloud provider, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks"><span class="caps">EKS</span></a> from <span class="caps">AWS</span> or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/"><span class="caps">AKS</span></a> from&nbsp;Azure.</li>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> and a basic understanding of how to use&nbsp;it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Familiarity with basic <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/">Kubernetes concepts</a> and some exposure to the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/">kubectl</a> command-line tool will make life easier. The introductory article I wrote on <a href="../../../../2019/01/10/deploying-python-ml-models-with-flask-docker-and-kubernetes/"><em>Deploying Python <span class="caps">ML</span> Models with Flask, Docker and Kubernetes</em></a>, is a good place to&nbsp;start.</p>
<h2 id="starting-with-a-solution-to-a-ml-task">Starting with a Solution to a <span class="caps">ML</span>&nbsp;Task</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">ML</span> problem we have chosen to use for this tutorial, is the classification of iris plants into one of their three sub-species using the famous <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#iris-dataset">iris plants dataset</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project/blob/master/ml_prototype_work.ipynb">ml_prototype_work notebook</a> found in the root of this tutorial&#8217;s GitHub repository, documents the trivial <span class="caps">ML</span> workflow used to train a Decision Tree classifier as a solution to this multi-class classification task, as well as to prototype some of the work that will be required to engineer and deploy the final prediction (or scoring)&nbsp;service.</p>
<h2 id="the-bodywork-project">The Bodywork&nbsp;Project</h2>
<p>Bodywork <span class="caps">ML</span> projects must be stored as Git repositories, from where pre-built Bodywork containers running on Kubernetes (k8s), can pull them. There are no build artefacts - such as Docker images - that need to be built as part of the deployment process. Take a look at the Git repository for the example project and you will find the following directory&nbsp;structure,</p>
<p><img alt="example_project_root" src="../../../../images/machine-learning-engineering/bodywork/example-project-root.png"></p>
<p>The sub-directories contain all the code required to run a single stage - for example, in the <code>stage-1-train-model</code> directory you will find the following&nbsp;files,</p>
<p><img alt="train_model_stage" src="../../../../images/machine-learning-engineering/bodywork/train-model-stage.png"></p>
<p>And similarly, in the <code>stage-2-deploy-scoring-service</code> directory you will find the following&nbsp;files,</p>
<p><img alt="deploy_model_stage" src="../../../../images/machine-learning-engineering/bodywork/deploy-model-stage.png"></p>
<p>The remainder of this tutorial will be spent explaining the purpose of these files and demonstrating how they are used to map the <span class="caps">ML</span> task developed within the Jupyter notebook, into a <span class="caps">ML</span> workflow that can be executed on a remote Kubernetes cluster, to provide a model-scoring service ready for&nbsp;production.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-a-bodywork-batch-stage-for-training-the-model">Configuring a Bodywork Batch Stage for Training the&nbsp;Model</h3>
<p>The <code>stage-1-train-model</code> directory contains the code and configuration required to train the model within a pre-built container on a k8s cluster, as a batch workload. Using the <a href="https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project/blob/master/ml_prototype_work.ipynb">ml_prototype_work notebook</a> as a reference, the <a href="https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project/blob/master/stage-1-train-model/train_model.py">train_model.py</a> module contains the code required&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>download data from an <span class="caps">AWS</span> S3&nbsp;bucket;</li>
<li>pre-process the data (e.g. extract labels for supervised&nbsp;learning);</li>
<li>train the model and compute performance metrics;&nbsp;and,</li>
<li>persist the model to the same <span class="caps">AWS</span> S3 bucket that contains the original&nbsp;data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project/blob/master/stage-1-train-model/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a> file lists the 3rd party Python packages that will be Pip-installed on the pre-built Bodywork host container, as required to run the <code>train_model.py</code> script. Finally, the <a href="https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project/blob/master/stage-1-train-model/config.ini">config.ini</a> file allows us to specify that this stage is a batch stage (as opposed to a service-deployment), that <code>train_model.py</code> should be the script that is run, as well as an estimate of the <span class="caps">CPU</span> and memory resources to request from the k8s cluster, how long to wait and how many times to retry,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-a-bodywork-service-deployment-stage-for-creating-a-ml-scoring-service">Configuring a Bodywork Service-Deployment Stage for Creating a <span class="caps">ML</span> Scoring&nbsp;Service</h3>
<p>The <code>stage-2-deploy-scoring-service</code> directory contains the code and configuration required to load the model trained in <code>stage-1-train-model</code> and use it as part of the code for a RESTful <span class="caps">API</span> endpoint definition, that will accept a single instance (or row) of data encoded as <span class="caps">JSON</span> in a <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request, and return the model’s prediction as <span class="caps">JSON</span> data in the corresponding <span class="caps">HTTP</span> response. We have decided to use the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> framework with which to create our <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> server, which will be deployed to k8s and exposed as a service on the cluster, after this stage completes. The use of Flask is <strong>not</strong> a requirement in any way and you are free to use different frameworks - e.g. <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com">FastAPI</a>.</p>
<p>Within this stage’s directory, <a href="https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project/blob/master/stage-2-deploy-scoring-service/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a> lists the 3rd party Python packages that will be Pip-installed on the Bodywork host container in order to run <a href="https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project/blob/master/stage-2-deploy-scoring-service/serve_model.py">serve_model.py</a>, which defines the <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span> server containing our <span class="caps">ML</span> scoring endpoint. The <a href="https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project/blob/master/stage-2-deploy-scoring-service/config.ini">config.ini</a> file allows us to specify that this stage is a service-deployment stage (as opposed to a batch stage), that <code>serve_model.py</code> should be the script that is run, as well as an estimate of the <span class="caps">CPU</span> and memory resources to request from the k8s cluster, how long to wait for the service to start-up and be ‘ready’, which port to expose and how many instances (or replicas) of the server should be created to stand-behind the&nbsp;cluster-service.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-complete-bodywork-workflow">Configuring the Complete Bodywork&nbsp;Workflow</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project/blob/master/bodywork.ini">bodywork.ini</a> file in the root of the project repository contains the configuration for the whole workflow - a workflow being a collection of stages, run in a specific order, that can be represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (or <span class="caps">DAG</span>). The most important element is the specification of the workflow <span class="caps">DAG</span>, which in this instance is&nbsp;simple,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="na">DAG</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;stage-1-train-model &gt;&gt; stage-2-deploy-scoring-service&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>i.e. train the model and then (if successful) deploy the scoring&nbsp;service.</p>
<h3 id="testing-the-workflow">Testing the&nbsp;Workflow</h3>
<p>Firstly, make sure that the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bodywork/">bodywork</a> package has been Pip-installed into a local Python environment that is active. Then, make sure that there is a namespace setup for use by bodywork projects - e.g. <code>iris-classification</code> - by running the following at the command&nbsp;line,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ bodywork setup-namespace iris-classification
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which should result in the following&nbsp;output,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>creating namespace=iris-classification
creating service-account=bodywork-workflow-controller in namespace=iris-classification
creating cluster-role-binding=bodywork-workflow-controller--iris-classification
creating service-account=bodywork-jobs-and-deployments in namespace=iris-classification
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, the workflow can be tested by running the workflow-controller locally&nbsp;using,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ bodywork workflow <span class="se">\</span>
    --namespace<span class="o">=</span>iris-classification <span class="se">\</span>
    https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project <span class="se">\</span>
    master
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which will run the workflow defined in the <code>master</code> branch of this GitHub repository, all within the <code>iris-classification</code> namespace. The logs from the workflow-controller and the containers nested within each constituent stage, will be streamed to the command-line to inform you on the precise state of the workflow, but you can also keep track of the current state of all k8s resources created by the workflow-controller in the <code>iris-classification</code> namespace, by using the kubectl <span class="caps">CLI</span> tool -&nbsp;e.g.,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ kubectl -n iris-classification get all
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once the workflow has completed, the <span class="caps">ML</span> scoring service deployed within your cluster can be tested from your local machine, by first of all running <code>kubectl proxy</code> in one shell, and then in a new shell use the <code>curl</code> tool as&nbsp;follows,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/iris-classification/services/bodywork-ml-ops-project--stage-2-deploy-scoring-service/proxy/iris/v1/score <span class="se">\</span>
    --request POST <span class="se">\</span>
    --header <span class="s2">&quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --data <span class="s1">&#39;{&quot;sepal_length&quot;: 5.1, &quot;sepal_width&quot;: 3.5, &quot;petal_length&quot;: 1.4, &quot;petal_width&quot;: 0.2}&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If successful, you should get the following&nbsp;response,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;species_prediction&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;setosa&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;probabilities&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;setosa=1.0|versicolor=0.0|virginica=0.0&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;model_info&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;DecisionTreeClassifier(class_weight=&#39;balanced&#39;, random_state=42)&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="executing-the-workflow-on-a-schedule">Executing the Workflow on a&nbsp;Schedule</h2>
<p>If you’re happy with the test results, then you can schedule the workflow-controller to operate remotely on the cluster as a k8s cronjob. As an example, to setup the the workflow to run every hour, use the following&nbsp;command,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ bodywork cronjob create <span class="se">\</span>
    --namespace<span class="o">=</span>iris-classification <span class="se">\</span>
    --name<span class="o">=</span>iris-classification <span class="se">\</span>
    --schedule<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;0 * * * *&quot;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --git-repo-url<span class="o">=</span>https://github.com/bodywork-ml/bodywork-ml-ops-project
    --git-repo-branch<span class="o">=</span>master
</code></pre></div>

<p>Each scheduled workflow will attempt to re-run the workflow, end-to-end, as defined by the state of this repository’s <code>master</code> branch at the time of execution - performing rolling-updates to service-deployments and automatic roll-backs in the event of&nbsp;failure.</p>
<p>To get the execution history for all <code>iris-classification</code> jobs&nbsp;use,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ bodywork cronjob <span class="nb">history</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --namespace<span class="o">=</span>iris-classification <span class="se">\</span>
    --name<span class="o">=</span>iris-classification
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which should return output along the lines&nbsp;of,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>JOB_NAME                                START_TIME                    COMPLETION_TIME               ACTIVE      SUCCEEDED       FAILED
iris-classification-1605214260          2020-11-12 20:51:04+00:00     2020-11-12 20:52:34+00:00     0           1               0
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then to stream the logs from any given cronjob run - e.g. to debug and/or monitor for errors -&nbsp;use,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ bodywork cronjob logs <span class="se">\</span>
    --namespace<span class="o">=</span>iris-classification <span class="se">\</span>
    --name<span class="o">=</span>iris-classification-1605214260
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning&nbsp;Up</h2>
<p>To clean-up the deployment in its entirety, delete the namespace using kubectl - e.g. by&nbsp;running,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ kubectl delete ns iris-classification
</code></pre></div>
